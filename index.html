        <section id="projectDescription">
          <p>The aim of this game is to sucessfully predict if the number rolled by a dice will be <b>odd</b> or <b>even</b></p>
          <p>With a normal dice, the chance of rolling odd or even is <b>50/50</b>. However, in this casino the game has been <b>rigged</b></p>
          <p>Your task is to use <b>reinforcement learning</b> to find out how you can increase your odds of winning</p>
          <p>To do this you will use a container of 10 red LEDs and 10 green LEDs to make your predictions and to keep track of how successful you have been</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Make a prediction by closing your eyes and taking an LED from your container</p>
                <p style="color: red;">Red = Even</p>
                <p style="color: green;">Green = Odd</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Click "Roll" to roll the dice</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>If the prediction was <b>correct</b>, put the LED back in the container</p>
                <p>If the prediction was <b>incorrect</b>, put the LED to the side</p>
              </li>
            </ol>  
            <p>After you have played <b>20 times</b>, count how many of each LED is in your container</p>
            <p>Using this information determine if you would be more <b>likely</b> to win if you predict odd or even?</p>
            <p>Roll the dice a further 20 times predicting which outcome you have found to be most likely. Keep track of how many times you win</p>
            <p><b>What has the machine learned?</b></p>
